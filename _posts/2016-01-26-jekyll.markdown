I'm new to the blogging scene, in fact I can count on my fingers the number of blog posts i've made in my lifetime. However, I do have experience creating websites and programming so I thought, why not give Jekyll a try? Jekyll is a ruby framework that transforms your plain text into static websites and blogs. I already picked up Ruby from my university courses so I figured this would be a great way to blog and satisfy my itch to code.

I chose [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) because it works seamlessly with github, its flexible, and it gives you a responsive site right out of the box.

The process is simple, you write your posts & pages in HTML & CSS and a static site come out ready to be deployed. If you're looking to start up you own website but don't want to dish out the ~$14.99/month in hosting fees, Jekyll sites can be hosted on GitHub pages for free.
