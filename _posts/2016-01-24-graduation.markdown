## GO BEARS!

After 3.5 years I've completed my Computer Science degree at UC Berkeley. I just want to say that i'm thankful for all of my friends and the memories we've shared during my time at Cal.

## Next Destination: Los Angeles

I'm writing this post from the comfort of my old home in LA where i'll be residing for the next few months. During this time, I plan on actively updating my website, reading and most importantly taking risks. Now I don't mean risks like putting myself in dangerous scenarios, but instead i'm talking about entrepreneurial risks. Whether it may be developing a new mobile app, taking on affiliate marketing or even learning how to code in a new language, my goal during the next few months is to discover myself and what i'm great at.
