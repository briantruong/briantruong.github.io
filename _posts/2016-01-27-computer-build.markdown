After almost 4 years of neglect, my poor desktop computer was due for an upgrade. I started by thinking I would be fine only upgrading my GPU and perhaps my CPU, but one decision led to another and I ended up replacing everything except for my tower (r.i.p wallet). I wanted a computer that could run video games on ultra, easily perform multiple tasks i.e. coding and streaming, and a system that would be future proof for the coming years. 

#The Breakdown

##CPU:
Intel i5-6600k
$256.99

Launched back in August 2015, the Skylake processor brings to the table better CPU and GPU performance with reduced power consumption. Wanting to build a computer that will remain viable for years to come and at only $27 more than the i5-4690k Haswell the Skylake was the clear winner. Of course this decision required that I find a new motherboard Z170 chipset and upgrade to DDR4 memory. The price of these upgrades would quickly surpass my original budget, but it was worth it.

##GPU:
####MSI Radeon R9 390 - $285.26

Between the GTX 970 and the R9 390 the choice was easy. The 390 had between benchmarks, more virtual ram and performs better in games. Additionally, I purchased the unit during a Jet.com promotion, saving a whopping 15% on the sticker price of $329.99 and even more by selecting to waive return shipping.

##Motherboard:
####Asus Z170-A ATX LGA1151 - $156.99

I struggled the most selected a Z170 chipset motherboard that I liked, but settled with the Asus Z170-A. Its a great mid-range motherboard with lots of great functionality and a really intuitive overclocking system.

##Memory:
####Kingston HyperX Fury Black 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4-2133 - $95.00

Great low profile sticks of ram (necessary if you have a large CPU cooler that covers some of your memory slots) not much else to say in this department.

##SSD:
####Samsung 850 EVO-Series 250GB - $84.00

With a 1TB HDD from my previous build, I figured why not purchase a solid state for my OS and other main application. Afterall they were selling at a great price. To save some time, I went to my local Fry's electronics to pick up the SDD. Thankfully so, I was able to get it price matched for $10 less than Amazon.

##CPU Cooler:
####LEPA AquaChanger 240 Liquid CPU Cooler - $40.00

Knowing little about all-in-one liquid coolers I was wary, but with Fry's holding a flash sale at 50% off retail price (originally $80.00) I took a shot in the dark. Thankfully, the installation was painless and quick and the cooler performs better than I could have imagined. It is practically silent during gaming and adds a unique flare to the interior of my build. 

##Power Supply:
####EVGA SuperNOVA G2 650W 80+ Gold - $89.99

Highly recommended PSU on reddit and is fully modular which is vital for cable management purposes.

At the time of purchase, the total cost of the build was $1008.23. More than I originally hoped to spend, but I am more than happy with the results. [View My Parts List Here](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/jYJKWZ)
