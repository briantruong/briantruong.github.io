After almost 4 years of neglect, my poor desktop computer was due for an upgrade. I started by thinking I would be fine only upgrading my GPU and perhaps my CPU, but one decision led to another and I ended up replacing everything except for my tower (r.i.p wallet). I wanted a computer that could run video games on ultra, easily perform multiple tasks i.e. coding and streaming, and a system that would be future proof for the coming years.
